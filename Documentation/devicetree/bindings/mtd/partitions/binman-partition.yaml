description: |
  This corresponds to a binman 'entry'. It is a single partition which holds
  data of a defined type.

allOf:
  - $ref: /schemas/mtd/partitions/partition.yaml#

properties:
  compatible:
    oneOf:
      - const: binman,entry     # generic binman entry
      - items:
          - const: u-boot       # u-boot.bin from U-Boot project
          - const: atf-bl31     # bl31.bin or bl31.elf from TF-A project

  align:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      This sets the alignment of the entry. The entry offset is adjusted
      so that the entry starts on an aligned boundary within the containing
      section or image. For example ‘align = <16>’ means that the entry will
      start on a 16-byte boundary. This may mean that padding is added before
      the entry. The padding is part of the containing section but is not
      included in the entry, meaning that an empty space may be created before
      the entry starts. Alignment should be a power of 2. If ‘align’ is not
      provided, no alignment is performed.

  align-size:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      This sets the alignment of the entry size. For example, to ensure
      that the size of an entry is a multiple of 64 bytes, set this to 64.
      While this does not affect the contents of the entry within binman
      itself (the padding is performed only when its parent section is
      assembled), the end result is that the entry ends with the padding
      bytes, so may grow. If ‘align-size’ is not provided, no alignment is
      performed.

  align-end:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      This sets the alignment of the end of an entry with respect to the
      containing section. Some entries require that they end on an alignment
      boundary, regardless of where they start. This does not move the start
      of the entry, so the contents of the entry will still start at the
      beginning. But there may be padding at the end. While this does not
      affect the contents of the entry within binman itself (the padding is
      performed only when its parent section is assembled), the end result is
      that the entry ends with the padding bytes, so may grow. If ‘align-end’
      is not provided, no alignment is performed.
